# GALLERY SITE

Since square footage is limited in the city, the site will function as the digital marketplace for a local gallery's small space and larger warehouse. To maintain the loose nature of the art world and to respect the ideals of the owner, the site will not function as a "cart- based" marketplace but one based on bids. The site will feature both fine art for hanging and a category we are calling goods (objects, furniture, etc). There will also be an events section to promote upcoming artist shows and features along with an archive for people to parouse through.
